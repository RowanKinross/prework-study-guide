# Prework Study Guide Webpage


## Description

A study guide for course pre-work for our bootcamp in front-end web develpment. The motivation to make this was to practice all basic aspects of coding to create a web-page, whilst simultaneously storing the large amounts of information and tips learned in an accessible place. It pushed our learning in a holistic way so that we could see how each individual element came together to build a whole. Its place on the cloud is also useful for remote access.

## Usage

The title acts as a start point, and summarises the content. Each section is then broken down to cover the individual topics including HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. If we open the DevTools console we can see the JavaScript running, it will list the topics from the prework and choose one for us to study first.
